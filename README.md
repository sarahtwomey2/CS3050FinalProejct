* input.txt
* input_error.h

### How to make the project

./gillisp_tpafzf_jlwyff_smtbz5.o <input file>
```

### Purpose of project
To read in a input file (Ex: input.txt) and load it into memory. Once in memory the input file should contain a start and end position for two "robots". If a start and end is found the program will run through a maze agorithm and create a route for the robots to go through the maze.
